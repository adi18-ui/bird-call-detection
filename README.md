# Cappuchin Bird Call Detection
This project focuses on detecting whether a Cappuchin bird call is present in an audio clip. Using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model processes audio spectrograms to classify audio segments effectively.

## Features

- **Spectrogram-based Input**: Converts audio files into spectrograms for visual representation of frequencies over time.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Utilizes deep learning for feature extraction and classification.
- **Accurate Bird Call Detection**: Trained and tested on relevant datasets for precise identification.
